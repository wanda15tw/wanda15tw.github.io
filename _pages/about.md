# Welcome to my blog!
# Hi, my name is Wanda Juan. 

I am a full stack data scientist with MBA and EECS SM degrees from MIT. Have a big dream to use data analytics to solve social and sustainable problems. I enjoy writing Python and developing web apps. AWS solution architect associate certified, I am a strong advocate for open source and cloud computing. Feel free to connect me via social medias on the left hand side.

Besides programming and doing data analysis, I love snowboarding, traveling, and spending time with my beloved family. I am happily married with one child and living in the great NY area. ðŸ˜†
